# `CATCH-THE-EGG`

This was my term project during my Level 1 - Term 1 at BUET.It is a re-implementation of the famous game `catch the egg`

The whole project is done using c and igraphics library.If you want to play the game just clone/download the files and run the main.cpp.(Use codeblocks for running and windows operating system)
